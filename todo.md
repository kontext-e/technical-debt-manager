* Experiment and Learn

* teaching good code quality
 - host and facilitate Code Retreats
 - Coding Dojos

* Architect and Technical Debt Manager can have conflicting goals, esp. if Architect is heavily influenced by a Project Manager

# Useful Tools
* IDE power user
 - also the lesser known features like Structural Search & Replace, Dependency Matrix
 - maybe create own plugins to watch special code places or make larger changes like changing a used library
 - example: IDEA SSR for replacing jMock by Mockito
 - example: IDEA Live Plugin
* SonarQube
* jQAssistant, Structure101, Sonargraph
* static code analysis tools
* Test Coverage tools
* Jenkins, Drone
* SCM Servers like Gogs, GitHub, Gitlab

* find best spots where to invest in code quality according to ROI
* helps the team with techniques how to tackle Technical Debt
* educates the team, e.g. Legacy Code Retreats
